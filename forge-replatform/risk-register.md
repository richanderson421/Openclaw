### 3) SEO traffic loss
- Impact: discovery decline
- Mitigation: redirect map, sitemap continuity, top-page parity before cutover

### 4) Team workflow friction
- Impact: ops slowdown
- Mitigation: train staff on new admin workflow, documented SOPs

### 5) Platform lock-in repeat
- Impact: future inflexibility
