# Crystal Commerce Template Pack (Forge)

Use this folder as a copy/paste library for Crystal Commerce content blocks.

## Goals
- Improve homepage conversion clarity
- Surface events and community quickly
- Keep messaging consistent across promos/policies

## Files
- `homepage-blocks.md` — hero, CTA rail, homepage sections
- `event-modules.md` — weekly event summary + game-specific modules
- `promo-banners.md` — short marketing banners by category
- `faq-policy-blocks.md` — trust/policy/FAQ snippets
- `copy-snippets/` — reusable short text snippets
- `assets/` — image specs and future creative assets

## Editing rules
- Keep snippets short and mobile-friendly.
- Prefer plain text + simple formatting compatible with Crystal modules.
- Version changes through Git commits so staff can roll back.
